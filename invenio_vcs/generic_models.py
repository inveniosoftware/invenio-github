"""
Generic dataclass models to represent the bare minimum necessary data from VCS providers.

These are essentially the "lowest common factor" of
the otherwise large, complex, and heterogenous responses returned by APIs.

These are used by higher-level calls to have a common set of data to
operate on. Provider implementations are responsible for converting API
responses into these generic classes.
